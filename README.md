# Simple_Java_Game-Snake

This is my first little game written in Java. Thank you all very much for your support. Next I will use Java to implement more classic games. 
I used `Gradle`'s `Kotlin` framework to write this game. This is the only framework I have learned so far. To launch the game, please find the program in the following directory: `Snake\app\src\main\java\snake\StartGame.java` .
